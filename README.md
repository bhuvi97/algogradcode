This is a simple algo code of my grad assignment.

The problem which I'm trying to solve is rod cutting problem. The rod cutting problem has been solved in three approaches 
    1) Recursive
    2) Memoized recursive
    3) Dynamic programing

A trial is conducted for 30 times and an average is recorded. A report with the detailed analysis can be found above.
